                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Key Stages talk over the sets of skills and knowledge a student is progressing to develop at a specific stage in their education. We document the training processed by using portfolios. In these portfolios, students place samples of their work throughout the year. Parents , thus, have a thought of classroom work, standards of accomplishment and the way their child’s skills are developing. There are four Key Stages throughout our Primary 1 — Secondary 11 classes. Key Stage 1 includes students at 5 to 7 years old. The core subjects are Mathematics, English and Science. Students are expected to be ready to read once they leave this Key Stage also as be able to do basic addition and subtractions. Socially, students are expected to be ready to listen to instructions and show some understanding of what an honest buddy is in classroom work and within the playground. Key Stage 2 is intended for college students aged 8 to 10 years. The core subjects remain English, Mathematics and Science. Literacy skills now move towards reading for meaning and teaching students a way to produce reports, recounts, instructions , and stories in writing. Students are expected to be able to do short spoken presentations and explanations of their work. French is introduced within the final year of Key Stage 2. In Key, Stages 1 and a couple of, students are taught by a school specialis In Key Stage 3 students aged 11-13 will now be taught by subject specialists. A head of every Key Stage are going to be in charge of the non-public follow-up of our students. On the program they'll have English, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, French, Danish, education , and Art. Students develop greater independence and skill for critical thinking at this stage. They're expected to develop their language to accommodates the spoken and written demands of their individual subjects. Key Stage 4, is the last of our school program. Students aged 14-16 choose ten subjects, from a spread of subjects, which they then study for 2 years before sitting for their IGCSE exams (International General Certificate of Secondary Education). Students should now be equipped with the abilities, independence and confidence to try to do well in upper education. IGCSE subjects are taught by subject specialists. Teachers mentor groups of scholars to confirm the private follow-up of every student. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paragraphing</p><p>Students in Stage 1 use their knowledge of text features to structure longer written texts. In order to support the logical organisation of information students need to be able to use paragraphs to group like ideas and separate longer texts into appropriate segments.</p><p></p><p>Strategy</p><p>Explicit teaching</p><p>Students need to understand that sentences focussed on one idea or like ideas can be grouped together within a longer text to form paragraphs.</p><p></p><p>Paragraphs break up large blocks of text (visually as well as for meaning) so that the reader can easily follow and digest the information or ideas contained in persuasive, informative and imaginative texts.</p><p></p><p>At this stage students should learn to use paragraphs to group sentences about like ideas; separate different ideas; or, segment distinct parts of the text.</p><p></p><p>General strategies</p><p>Name, identify and explain the purpose of paragraphs in texts. Embed the terminology in your teaching to familiarise students with the paragraph as a text feature. For example, instead of asking ‘Who would like to read next?’ say ‘I read the first paragraph and I would like someone else to read the next paragraph.’</p><p></p><p>When reading shared texts in any learning areas or during guided reading, draw students attention to the use of paragraphs. Where possible prompt students before reading so that they can focus on that aspect during the reading.</p><p></p><p>For example - The text on this page is organised in three paragraphs. As I read it, I want you to think about why the writing has been organised that way. I will ask you for your ideas after I have read it.</p><p></p><p>Explicitly teach students to plan and compose texts in paragraphs with a range of graphic organisers or text scaffolds appropriate to the learning area and subject matter.</p><p></p><p>Engage students with frequent experiences of reading and viewing texts organised with a range of text features.

So, if a someone goes to college and just waste their time they are going to waste money from them or their parents. Since many people pay their classes to get into college, they will work and study more than they usually did in high school. Here you build your own time schedule. The decisions a student makes and the effect of those decisions will be theirs and theirs only, because now a student is an adult in college who their parents do not need to be telling them what to do.…</p><p></p><p>#Hope it helps</p><br />
