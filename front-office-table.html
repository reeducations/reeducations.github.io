                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>*Mixed Hazards</p><p>Slips, Trips and Falls
</p><p>
</p><p>Universal slip, trip and fall culprits include unattended spills, wet floors, exposed cords, unstable work surfaces, uneven floors, loose rugs and cluttered areas.
</p><p>
</p><p>Inclement weather conditions, such as rain, snow and ice, create outdoor slip hazards on exterior steps, ramps, walkways, entry and exit areas, and parking lots, and indoor hazards when wet floors are not cleaned up promptly. Ice-melting products and nonslip runners can greatly reduce slip, trip and fall hazards during winter months.
</p><p>
</p><p>Clean up all spills immediately, and post signs identifying hazards in areas that are being cleaned or that have recently been cleaned, and in areas prone to water accumulation and wet surfaces.
</p><p>
</p><p>Office walkways should be kept clear, as boxes and other clutter can create a trip hazard.
</p><p>
</p><p>Electrical and telephone cords should also be properly secured and not stretched across aisles or walkways, and carpets should not be frayed or buckled.</p><p></p><p>*Caution</p><p>Position the chair, keyboard and monitor in a straight line with your body.
</p><p>
</p><p>Maintain a relaxed, neutral posture.
</p><p>Sit up straight, adjusting the chair to provide firm back support.
</p><p>
</p><p>Let your arms hang loosely at the shoulders.
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep your elbows at a 90-degree angle while typing.</p><p></p><p>*Danger </p><p>Other office hazards include sprains and strains, poor workstation ergonomics, indoor air-quality problems, insufficient or excessive lighting, noise, electrical hazards and random acts of violence.</p><p></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO </p><br />
