I expect the division superintendent, the school principals, the district supervisors, and all classroom teachers to join hands with me in my efforts to make both the present and the coming generations responsible people. I want you, young men and young women, to be the right kind of men and women who will be able to assume that burden which our people will face once we are an independent nation. True patriotism does not consist in shouting your love for your country. True patriotism is shown in your everyday life. True patriotism does not consist in shouting that you are willing to die for your country. We are not bound to be heroes all the time; nor is there an opportunity to be heroes every day. Just do your duty every day and you will be patriots. As a student your duty is to study well and as a man to be good. Your duty is to work well until you become a good citizen. And don't give too much importance to clothing, good eating, and pleasure. Eat enough to keep you healthy, dress well to look decent, enjoy enough to give your spirit emotion and your nerves relaxation, but all the time you must have an objective in your life, have an idea-a noble idea-and pursue it.please answer this seriously because I really need this.​</a>

Just do your duty every day and you will be patriots. As a student your duty is to study well and as a man to be good. Your duty is to work well until you become a good citizen. And don't give too much importance to clothing, good eating, and pleasure. Eat enough to keep you healthy, dress well to look decent, enjoy enough to give your spirit emotion and your nerves relaxation, but all the time you must have an objective in your life, have an idea-a noble idea-and pursue it.please answer this seriously because I really need this.​</h2><br />
