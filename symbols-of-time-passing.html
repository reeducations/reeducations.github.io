Translate it into mathematical symbols or equations and solve for the answer. Procedures to be followed. Step 1 - Create your own 3 short routine math word problems that uses algebraic expression and egi with numbers, operational symbols, quantity (), and variables. Ex. The sum of twice x and 10 is 50. Step 2 - Translate it into mathematical symbols. 2x + 10 = 50 Step 3 - Solve for the answer. 2x + 10 - 10 = 50 -10 Step 2 - Translate it into mathematical symbols. 2x = 40 (divide both sides by 2 to 2 2 get the value of x) Step 3 - Solve for the answer. x = 20 - = Category 4 3 2. 1 Completion All of the assigned work is complete.

A man is driving his sports car down a four-lane highway at 40 m/s. He comes up behind a slow-moving dump truck and decides to pass it in the left-hand lane. If Nathaniel can accelerate at 5m/s², how long will it take for him to reach the speed of 60 m/s²? 
- 
If a car, with an initial velocity of 20m/s, accelerates at a rate of 5m/s² for 3 seconds, what will its final velocity be 
MOTION IN ONE DIMENTION
a. Speed – refers to how fast the object is moving. It tells you the distance the object travels in a period of time. In symbols, ​
S = d/t​
Where:​
S = speed​
d = distance​
t = time​
Lydia de Vega is a world known Filipino track and field athlete. She can run the 100.0 m dash in about 11.0 seconds. What is her average speed?​
Given: d=100.0 m​
t = 11.0 s​
RTF (required to find) = average speed​
​
Solution:​
S = d/t​
S = 100.0m/11.0s​
S = 9.09 m/s​

Velocity – aside from identifying the rate of a moving body, we also take into consideration the direction of motion. With this, we use the term velocity.​
In equation, we can express velocity as: ​
v = d/t​
Where:​
v = velocity​
d = displacement (distance + direction)​
t = time​

Example problem for Velocity:​
The car is heading north covering a distance of 500 meters in 20.0 seconds. What is the car’s velocity?​
Given: d = 500 m​
t = 20 s​
RTF (required to find) = v​
Solution:​
v = d/t​
v = 500m/20.0s​
v = 25.0 m/s, north​

c. Acceleration –
Formula: acceleration = change in velocity ​
time​
In symbols, a = ∆ v where:​
t a = acceleration ​
a = Vf – Vi vf = final velocity​
t vi = initial velocity​
t = time​</a>

Ebranothere wflowersLong ago, there were two different flowers planted in frontof Aling Diding's house. She cultivated the plants very well, untilone day, they began to bloom. These flowers are Rose andSampaguita. Rose had red flowers. It was beautiful.Sampaguita had white flowers. It was lovely. Aling Diding spentmost of her time picking weeds in the garden. For her, flowersgave a wonderful feeling.Every time people passed by, they stopped and looked atthe flowers. Rose flowers caught people's attention due to theirattractive colors. Rose had a romantic scent. Rose becamepopular in town. She was very happy because everybody saidshe was beautiful. Rose symbolized love. On the contrary, herheart was full of hatred and arrogance. She even teasedSampaguita as a nasty flower for not having a good scent anda catchy color. Sampaguita never argued with Rose. Sheremained calm and true to herself. She believed that eachflower has its own unique characteristics. Sampaguitasymbolized a pure and kind heart.Days gone by, Rose was busy flaunting her flowers andeventually became arrogant. She claimed herself to be themost expensive and the most beautiful flower in the lanc.However, a storm came. Heavy rain poured and did notstop the whole day and night. When the flowers woke up thenext morning, Rose was excited to open her petals and wasshocked that they had lost their colors.​</a>

Voltage is a measure of the number of charges passing through a cross section of a conductor in a given time.3. In an electrical circuit, the current flows from the point where the electrical potential is highest to the point where it is lowest.4. The direction of the flow of electrons is from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.5. The ampere (symbol: A) is the unit used to measure current intensity.6. Voltage (potential difference) is the energy used by every unit charge to move from one point to another.7. Voltage is inversely proportional to current.8. Current and electrons are directly proportional.9. The unit for voltage is Volt (symbol:V)10. Andre Marie - Ampere was the one who formulate the Ohm's Law​</a>

Voltage is a measure of the number of charges passing through a cross section of a conductor in a given time.3. In an electrical circuit, the current flows from the point where the electrical potential is highest to the point where it is lowest.4. The direction of the flow of electrons is from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.5. The ampere (symbol: A) is the unit used to measure current intensity.6. Voltage (potential difference) is the energy used by every unit charge to move from one point to another.7. Voltage is inversely proportional to current.8. Current and electrons are directly proportional.9. The unit for voltage is Volt (symbol:V)10. Andre Marie - Ampere was the one who formulate the Ohm's Law.​</a>

A man is driving his sports car down a four-lane highway at 40 m/s. He comes up behind a slow-moving dump truck and decides to pass it in the left-hand lane. If Nathaniel can accelerate at 5m/s², how long will it take for him to reach the speed of 60 m/s²? 
- 
If a car, with an initial velocity of 20m/s, accelerates at a rate of 5m/s² for 3 seconds, what will its final velocity be 
MOTION IN ONE DIMENTION
a. Speed – refers to how fast the object is moving. It tells you the distance the object travels in a period of time. In symbols, ​
S = d/t​
Where:​
S = speed​
d = distance​
t = time​
Lydia de Vega is a world known Filipino track and field athlete. She can run the 100.0 m dash in about 11.0 seconds. What is her average speed?​
Given: d=100.0 m​
t = 11.0 s​
RTF (required to find) = average speed​
​
Solution:​
S = d/t​
S = 100.0m/11.0s​
S = 9.09 m/s​

Velocity – aside from identifying the rate of a moving body, we also take into consideration the direction of motion. With this, we use the term velocity.​
In equation, we can express velocity as: ​
v = d/t​
Where:​
v = velocity​
d = displacement (distance + direction)​
t = time​

Example problem for Velocity:​
The car is heading north covering a distance of 500 meters in 20.0 seconds. What is the car’s velocity?​
Given: d = 500 m​
t = 20 s​
RTF (required to find) = v​
Solution:​
v = d/t​
v = 500m/20.0s​
v = 25.0 m/s, north​

c. Acceleration –
Formula: acceleration = change in velocity ​
time​
In symbols, a = ∆ v where:​
t a = acceleration ​
a = Vf – Vi vf = final velocity​
t vi = initial velocity​
t = time​</h2><br />

She cultivated the plants very well, untilone day, they began to bloom. These flowers are Rose andSampaguita. Rose had red flowers. It was beautiful.Sampaguita had white flowers. It was lovely. Aling Diding spentmost of her time picking weeds in the garden. For her, flowersgave a wonderful feeling.Every time people passed by, they stopped and looked atthe flowers. Rose flowers caught people's attention due to theirattractive colors. Rose had a romantic scent. Rose becamepopular in town. She was very happy because everybody saidshe was beautiful. Rose symbolized love. On the contrary, herheart was full of hatred and arrogance. She even teasedSampaguita as a nasty flower for not having a good scent anda catchy color. Sampaguita never argued with Rose. Sheremained calm and true to herself. She believed that eachflower has its own unique characteristics. Sampaguitasymbolized a pure and kind heart.Days gone by, Rose was busy flaunting her flowers andeventually became arrogant. She claimed herself to be themost expensive and the most beautiful flower in the lanc.However, a storm came. Heavy rain poured and did notstop the whole day and night. When the flowers woke up thenext morning, Rose was excited to open her petals and wasshocked that they had lost their colors.​</h2><br />
